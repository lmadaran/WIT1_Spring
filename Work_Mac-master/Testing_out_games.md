# Games in Pygame

Pygame has the resources to create many different kind of games! Here is a list of games you can run on pygame. Make sure you have the **Terminal** opened and ready to go.


## Aliens
The classic 2D alien-shooter game that we used to test that python works. 

Run the game by entering: `python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens`

## Hit the Chimp
A 2D game that uses the mouse cursor and left-click to test your agility.

Run the game by entering: `python3 -m pygame.examples.chimp`

## Stars

Not  really a "game" but still shows off the cool animations possible in Pygame!

Run the game by entering: `python3 -m pygame.examples.stars`

### Other cool stuff

Lots of cool art and animation ideas for your game. 

Run them by entering:
```
python3 -m pygame.examples.liquid
python3 -m pygame.examples.testsprite
python3 -m pygame.examples.fonty
```
